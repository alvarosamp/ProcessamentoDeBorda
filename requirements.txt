# Requirements for ProcessamentoDeBorda
# Core libraries used by the scripts (ultralytics, OpenCV, numpy, torch)
ultralytics>=8.3.233
torch>=2.0.0
opencv-python>=4.7.0
numpy>=1.23.0

# TFLite runtime (often used on Raspberry Pi / ARM). On Windows you may
# prefer to install `tensorflow` instead of `tflite-runtime`.
tflite-runtime

# ONNX export & runtime (used/produced by Exportacao.py)
onnx>=1.12.0,<1.20.0
onnxruntime
onnx-tf
onnx2tf
onnx_graphsurgeon
onnxslim
sng4onnx

# Optional: TensorFlow and tf_keras for SavedModel/TFLite conversion
# Note: TensorFlow can be heavy and platform-sensitive (Python version matters).
tensorflow>=2.19.0,<2.21.0
tf_keras<=2.19.0

# Notes:
# - `ai-edge-litert` / `ai_edge_litert` is referenced by some conversion tools
#   but is not available on the public PyPI. If you require it, install via
#   the vendor/NVIDIA index or follow vendor instructions.
# - Installing `tflite-runtime` on Windows is uncommon; on Windows use
#   `pip install tensorflow` (above) to obtain the TensorFlow converter.
# - Some packages (onnx-tf, onnx2tf) may require specific Python versions
#   (e.g., 3.10/3.11) and matching TensorFlow wheel availability.
# - For reproducible student environment, consider creating a small
#   instructions section in the README telling students to use a specific
#   Python version and how to set up the venv.
